## New Features

### Enhanced AI-powered GitHub Issue Resolution System

We've updated our system to provide more flexible response options after the initial pull request (PR) submission. Here are the key new functionalities:

1. **Partial PR Updates**: The AI can now make targeted changes to specific parts of an existing PR.

2. **Full PR Regeneration**: We've maintained the ability to completely regenerate the entire solution if needed.

3. **Flexible Response System**: Users can now choose between:
   a) Requesting specific updates to parts of a PR
   b) Regenerating the entire PR

4. **Iterative Improvement Workflow**: The system now analyzes feedback or review comments on the initial PR and allows the AI to submit follow-up commits addressing specific issues or requested changes.

5. **Version Control Integration**: We've implemented proper handling of potential conflicts with the base branch during both partial updates and full regenerations.

6. **Tracking and Reporting**: A new system tracks the history of changes, iterations, and regenerations for each issue.

7. **Updated User Interface**: The interface has been modified to accommodate the new options, allowing users to easily select between partial updates and full regeneration.

## How to Use

1. Create a new issue or select an existing one.
2. Choose between "Partial Update" or "Full Regeneration".
3. For partial updates, provide specific feedback or review comments.
4. Click "Run" to generate or update the PR.
5. Review the changes and iterate as needed.
